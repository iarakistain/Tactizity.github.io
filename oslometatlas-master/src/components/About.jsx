            <p>Since 2015, increased internationalization of education and research has been a priority for OsloMet. The initiative is in line with international and national guidelines for the area and is, among other things, operationalized in main objective 3 of Strategy 2024: Oslo. It must be a urban university, with regional and national tasks and with a clear international character.</p>
            
            <p>OsloMet's efforts for knowledge cooperation with countries in the Global South are based on the 2030 agenda and UN sustainability goals. OsloMet is with its professional education, p. a. in health, education, journalism, business development and engineering, particularly relevant for knowledge cooperation with developing countries.
            OsloMet prioritizes the following main topics among the UN's sustainability goals:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Health, linked to UN Sustainability Objectives 3</li>
                <li>Urban challenges, linked to UN Sustainability Objective 11, or UN Sustainable Objective 11.</li>
